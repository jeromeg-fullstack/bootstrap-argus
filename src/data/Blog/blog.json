Therefore, we’re talking about everything from your personal computer, smartphone, and TV to extractor hoods, digital cameras, fridges, and even vacuum cleaners. That’s to say, basically, every single electronic device that we use on a daily basis. What are the advantages of selling in a sector like this one?</p> <blockquote class='blockquote'><p>According to Global B2C E-commerce, (an organization that analyzes the profiles and behaviors of online buyers globally), the consumer electronics sector is the most mature e-commerce sector in Europe, North America, and Asia and is growing at an average rate of 21.5%.</p></blockquote><p>However, not everything about the sector screams perfection, so what are the problems? The market is dominated by giants such as Amazon, Media Markt, and other department stores that can compete on price. As we have already mentioned, with giants controlling everything in such a large sector, there’s a big problem for the smaller e-commerce shops: how can we get clients to choose us instead of Amazon?</p>",

Alarm systems are installed for the purpose of keeping your home and family safer. Some buyers will likely look at the price of an alarm system and see if the added monetary value it brings is enough to justify the cost of your home. Perhaps more buyers, though, will consider the benefits a home alarm system brings instead. They will think of the added safety, security, and peace of mind that comes with having a system. This will not only make increase the perceived value of your home, but it will have buyers questioning whether or not they should buy other homes that do not have alarm systems installed.</p>",

Numerous studies and surveys featuring ex-con interviews have been published over the years, and it now seems to be common knowledge that visible cameras are a big deterrent for would-be burglars. We can only imagine that porch pirates looking to make a quick buck off of your packages feel the same way. If you have cameras positioned on your porch, toward the front of your house, or by your garage, the chances are you will get a good look at anyone who attempts to steal your packages. This doesn’t ensure that a package theft won’t steal your deliveries, but with footage of the thief, police have a good chance of catching the perpetrator. Not to mention, the cameras themselves should be more than enough to send package thieves toward easier targets.</p>",

If you’ve ever used a keycard or keyfob to enter an office building, then you should be somewhat familiar with the concept. A key card or key fob is programmed with a set of specific access permissions.

You have fifty employees who work on the factory floor. These employees are split up into three shifts, so the doors to the factory are always unlocked. You’re concerned about random individuals walking into the factory and stealing inventory.

These cameras work in a pretty straightforward manner. Once an image has been picked by the camera, it is taken to the monitor and then recorded on videotape or DVR. Analog cameras rely on a number of composite wires for power and communication.</p> <blockquote class='blockquote'><p>Lower cost – Since they are an older technology, analog cameras are cheaper than newer IP cameras (which we will get to shortly). Greater Compatibility – With analog, it is easy to mix and match different cameras. If you already have some analog cameras that you wish to continue using, it will be much easier to integrate them with other new analog systems. When purchasing a new camera system, however, your best bet is to go with IP cameras. Which brings us to our next section.</p></blockquote><p>As the name implies, night vision cameras are used at night or in very low light conditions. On most of these cameras, the night vision operates automatically. Sensors detect a change in lighting and switch to night vision mode, which is a rather simple process. The front of the camera is covered with powerful LED bulbs, and when it gets dark out, the LEDs turn on and cover the camera’s field of view with infrared light.</p>",

To give a great report, you should write or record the details of the break-in as soon as possible following the event. If your business was broken into after hours, record the time you discovered it, note any initial property damage you see and document any actions you took before the authorities arrived. If you or another employee was present at the time of the break-in, write down anything about the intruders as well. Answering questions like the examples below can be a tremendous help to officers.</p>",
